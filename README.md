# Render Example Project

This project is an example playground object transforms and imaging in rust.
It consists of 2 projects, 1 to produce the images and the other to deliver them to a user via a browser.

## Executables

### Renderer

This project produces images that updates by console inputs from the user:

Left Arrow/Right Arrow: Rolls the object
Up/Down Arrow: Pitches the object
Z/X: Yaws the object

ESC: Stops the Renderer

### Img_svr

This project serves images generated by the renderer via a browser.

## Running the project

Open 2 console windows:

### 1/ First Console

```
cd img_svr
cargo run
```

Then open a browser at:

```
http:/127.0.0.1:8080/
```

### 2/ Second Console

```
cd renderer
cargo run
```

Then use the keys to update the image in the browser and then press ESC when done.
